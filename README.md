# Escape Room Online 

This project consists of a web platform that offers online escape rooms.
Users must register to be able to explore and play in different escape rooms from the comfort of their homes. In addition, the administrator has access to a control panel (dashboard) for the management of the escape rooms, being able to add, edit or delete rooms as necessary.

It currently has an escape room called Hacker Challenge, which consists of simulating that the user's computer has been "hacked" and in order to recover it, the user must face 3 mini-game tests.
